    <p>Founded in 2012 as private animal rescue, RCBB officially became a nonprofit in 2015 and is the longest 
    standing registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit in the immediate tri-state area of WV, KY, OH dedicated to the rescue 
    of bully breed dogs who are at urgent risk in local shelters.</p>

    <p>We are a small 100% volunteer run, foster home based organization located in Huntington, WV, and 
    immediate surrounding tri-state area of WV, KY, OH. We are dedicated to the rescue of bully breed dogs who 
    are at high risk of euthanasia in local shelters. We spay/neuter, provide medical care, food and all other 
    necessities. Each dog in our care is loved as a family member by our foster families and integrated into our 
    daily lives where we get to know their personalities to match them with the best possible forever home.</p>
   
    <p>In addition to our rescue and re-homing efforts, we strive to increase positive public awareness, protect dog’s 
    labeled “pit bull” from discrimination, and the importance of treating each dog as an individual, regardless 
    of breed or physical appearance. RCBB also provides assistance to help reduce the number of dogs being 
    surrendered to shelters and rescues through our spay/neuter assistance programs and helping families facing 
    breed discrimination issues. RCBB promotes compassion and responsibility in our community towards all 
    animals.</p>
