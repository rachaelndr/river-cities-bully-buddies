        <h2>Meet Isadora</h2>
            <p>Isadora (also know as Schnozette and Izzy) is approximately 9-10 years old, she is a Miniature Bull terrier weighting around 
                45lbs. She has had a tough life (she looks a disaster- stained, scarred and calloused), but is the happiest, sweetest, most 
                carefree girl you could ever meet! She has a great spirit and she is always smiling and tail wagging!</p>
            <p>Izzy loves her dog pal friends (her size and larger, has not been around small dogs while in our care) and considerate people of 
                all ages, even though she is like a little bull in a china shop.</p>
            <p>NO KITTIES, please! She is not a fan! </p>
            <p>Izzy does not like the crate, but has acclimated pretty well with treat motivation. She cannot go long periods of time without 
                going outside to pee. It does not seem to be a medical issue, we think she was most likely always a outdoor dog and not custom 
                to indoor life.</p>
            <p>She is a strong little gal, walks fairly well on leash most times though. Izzy is pretty active for her age, but also enjoys 
                lounging at your feet and on her bed.</p>
            <p>Isadora does suffer from chronic ear issues that require daily medication to keep her comfortable, the years and years of 
                neglect make it impossible to remedy the situation, just manage it. Other than that she will not take much to keep happy and 
                comfortable and we guarantee this gal is well worth it! </p>

            <p class="policy">PLEASE READ our adoption policies/requirements before submitting a application, thank you!</p>
