        <h2 class="toggleSect">Sponsor a Rescue Dog</h2>
        <div class="sect">
            <p>To help us in our efforts, we have decided to start a "Sponsor a Rescue Dog Program" to help us ensure that each dog in our care 
                is happy and healthy while searching for their forever home! It is an excellent way you can help save a life, even if you are 
                unable to foster or adopt. By sponsoring one of our dogs, you help provide him/her with food, toys, treats, and vet care! 
                Sponsoring helps to offset our costs- in turn enabling us to help more dogs in need! Together we can make a difference!</p>
            <p>RCBB will keep you informed of your sponsor dog’s progress. Your name will also appear on our page as a sponsor (in that dog’s
                album), or your sponsorship may remain anonymous if you prefer. Here is the list of sponsor levels, but of course any 
                amount is accepted and appreciated.</p>
